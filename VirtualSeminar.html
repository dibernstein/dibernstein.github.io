      <td colspan="5"><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing us all to stay home, foregoing conferences and departmental seminars for the next few months. This weekly virtual seminar is an attempt to patch that departmental-seminar-sized void in our lives until it is safe to resume our more traditional forms of professional networking. Since geographic location matters a lot less for a virtual seminar than for an in-person seminar, this virtual seminar will be defined purely by its mathematical theme, algebraic matroids and rigidity theory, and not any particular department nor region.</p>

There is a password that I will send to the attendee list. When you enter, your microphone will be muted. If you want to ask a question, click the "raise hand" button.
      If the speaker engages you, then unmute your microphone to ask your question.
      Be sure to re-mute once the speaker has finished addressing your question.
      There is also a group chat where people can type their questions (and answers).</td>

    <td>The algebraic matroid of a Hadamard product of linear spaces</td>

  <tr style="vertical-align:top">
    <td>&ensp;</td>
    <td><strong>Abstract:</strong></td>
    <td> The algebraic matroid underlying a variety $V \subseteq \mathbb{C}^E$ is the combinatorial structure obtained by recording the dimensions of all coordinate projections of V. Understanding the algebraic matroids underlying particular varieties is useful in rigidity theory, matrix completion, and phylogenetics. In this talk, I will show how the algebraic matroid underlying a Hadamard product of two linear spaces can be derived from the matroids underlying each linear space using a construction of Edmonds and Rota. An immediate corollary is Laman's theorem from Rigidity theory. </td>

    <td><strong>Abstract:</strong></td>
    <td> A well-known combinatorial algorithm can decide generic rigidity in the plane by determining if the graph is of Pollaczek-Geiringer-Laman type. Methods from matroid theory have been used to prove other interesting results, again under the assumption of generic configurations. However, configurations arising in applications may not be generic. We present Theorem 7 and its corresponding Algorithm 1 which decide if a configuration is epsilon-locally rigid, a notion we define. This provides a partial answer to a problem discussed in the 2011 paper of Hauenstein, Sommese, and Wampler. We also use numerical algebraic geometry to find nearby valid configurations which are not obtained by rigid motions. This is joint work with Andrew Frohmader. </td>

    <td>Identifiability in Phylogenetics using Algebraic Matroids</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="vertical-align:top">
    <td>&ensp;</td>
    <td><strong>Abstract:</strong></td>
    <td>  Identifiability is a crucial property for a statistical model since it implies that distributions in the model uniquely determine the parameters that produce them. In phylogenetics, the identifiability of the tree parameter is of particular interest since it means that phylogenetic models can be used to infer evolutionary histories from data. Typical strategies for proving identifiability results require Gröbner basis computations which become untenable as the size of the model grows. In this talk I'll give some background on phylogenetic algebraic geometry and then discuss a new computational strategy for proving the identifiability of discrete parameters in algebraic statistical models that uses algebraic matroids naturally associated to the models. This algorithm allows us to avoid computing Gröbner bases and is also parallelizable. </td>

    <td>Rigidity of 2D and 3D quasicrystal frameworks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="vertical-align:top">
    <td>&ensp;</td>
    <td><strong>Abstract:</strong></td>
    <td> Deciding wether a generic 2D rod-and-pinion framework is rigid can be done by checking that its  underlying graph satisfies the Laman conditions. For frameworks with a special configuration such as grids of squares, there is a simpler way to associate a graph to the framework and decide if it is rigid or not. In this talk I will consider frameworks that come from Penrose tilings and show that we can decide the rigidity of these frameworks as we do for grids of squares. There is no generalization of Laman conditions for rigidity of 3D graphs but perhaps we can prove (conjecture) a generalization of 2D results for cubical frameworks or 3D quasicrystals. Pictures and real time interactive animations will be present throughout this talk to illustrate important concepts. This talk is based on joint work with George Francis and students from the Illinois Geometry Lab. </td>
