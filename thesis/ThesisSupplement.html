  <p>The file <a href="prop4.3.1.m2">prop4.3.1.m2</a> provides Macaulay 2 code that uses 4ti2 to verify the non-unimodularity of certain complexes in Proposition 4.3.1. The file <a href="prop4.7.2.m2">prop4.7.2.m2</a> provides Macaulay 2 code that uses 4ti2 to verify the non-unimodularity of certain complexes in Proposition 4.7.2. In each case the code exhibits a Graver basis element of the corresponding matrix which has an entry of absolute value greater than 1.</p>
  <p>Below is a Maple worksheet which generates the polyhedral subdivision of the space of dissimilarity maps on four elements referenced therein. The polyhedral subdivision is stored in a 37-element array called &quot;Districts.&quot; Each entry of the array is a two-element list where the second entry is a set of trees and the first entry is a list of polyhedral cones comprising the district labeled by those trees. To execute these computations in Maple:</p>
  <p>1) Check that you have a version of Maple that supports the package PolyhedralSets (available in Maple2015 and later versions)<br />
    2) Download and unzip <a href="MapleSupplement_4LeafDistricts.mw.zip">this file</a><br />
    3) Open the file MapleSupplement_4LeafDistricts.mw in Maple<br />
    4) Evaluate the worksheet (this could take an hour or so)<br />
