<p><strong><font size="+1">Supplementary Materials for &quot;L-infinity optimization to linear spaces and phylogenetic trees&quot;</font></strong></p>
<td><p>This webpage contains supplementary material for the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05127"> L-infinity optimization to linear spaces and phylogenetic trees</a> by Daniel Irving Bernstein  and Colby Long.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We provide a Maple worksheet which generates the polyhedral subdivision of the space of dissimilarity maps on four elements referenced therein.
  The polyhedral subdivision is stored in a 37-element array called &quot;Districts.&quot;
  Each entry of the array
  is a two-element list where the second entry is a set of trees and the first entry is a list of
  polyhedral cones comprising the district labeled by those trees. To execute these computations in Maple:</p>
<p>1) Check that you have a version of Maple that supports the package PolyhedralSets (available in Maple2015 and later versions)<br />
2) Download and unzip <a href="MapleSupplement_4LeafDistricts.mw.zip">this file</a><br />
3) Open the file MapleSupplement_4LeafDistricts.mw in Maple<br />
4) Evaluate the worksheet (this could take an hour or so)<br />
