        I am an assistant professor in the <a href = https://sse.tulane.edu/math> Tulane University Department of Mathematics</a>. Broadly speaking, my research focuses on geometric, algebraic, and combinatorial structures that arise in statistics, data science, bioinformatics, and structural rigidity.

      <p>From 2018-2021, I was an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow at MIT where my postdoc mentor was <a href = "https://www.carolineuhler.com/"> Caroline Uhler</a>. During that time, I also did short stints at Brown University as a postdoc in the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) during the <a href = "https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f18/"> semester program on nonlinear algebra</a> (Fall 2018), at Duke University as a Research Associate (Fall 2020), and at the Fields institute as the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/honours-and-fellowships/jerrold-e-marsden-postdoctoral-fellows"> Jerrold E. Marsden Postdoctoral Fellow</a> during the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/20-21/constraint"> Thematic Program on Geometric Constraint Systems, Framework Rigidity, and Distance Geometry</a> (Spring 2021).
      </a></p>

      <p>
      In May 2018, I graduated from North Carolina State University with a PhD in mathematics. My advisor was <a href="https://sethsullivant.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">Seth Sullivant</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Davidson College.</p>
