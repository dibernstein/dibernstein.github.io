<p class="style1"><strong>Math 242 --  Calculus III</strong></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Spring 2016, &nbsp;MW 6:00--7:50 PM, SAS 2229</strong></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Instructor:</strong> Daniel Irving Bernstein, office: 4123 SAS Hall, email: <a href="mailto:dibernst@ncsu.edu">dibernst@ncsu.edu</a></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Office Hours:</strong> Tuesday 3:00--4:00 PM, Thursday 4:00 - 5:00 PM, or by appointment</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Text:</strong> Franke, Griggs, and Norris, <em>Calculus III for Engineers and Scientists</em>, included with WebAssign.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Math 241 or equivalent.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Course Description: </strong> In Calculus I and II, you learned all about differentiation and integration of real-valued functions of a single variable - that is, functions with one input and one output. Here in Calculus III, we will generalize these ideas to vector-valued functions and functions of multiple variables. That is, functions with multiple inputs and/or outputs. More specifically, we will cover basic euclidean geometry in three dimensions, geometry of curves in three dimensions, limits, derivatives, and integrals of real-valued functions of multiple variables, line and surface integrals, and some vector calculus.
<p class="style1"><strong>Extra Help: </strong>You may stop by my office for extra help during my scheduled office hours. Drop-in tutoring is available all day at the <a href="https://www.math.ncsu.edu/mmc/">Mathematics Multimedia Center</a> in SAS 2103-2105.
<p class="style1"><strong>Schedule: </strong> Is available <a href="schedule.html"> here</a>. 

<p class = "style1"><strong> Class Format: </strong> Each class meeting will be broken up into two fifty minute lectures with a ten minute break in between.
Class will have the traditional lecture format with periodic stops for you to work on problems I give you.
I encourage you to inturrupt me with questions - if you are confused about something I say, then there is a good chance that someone else in the room is confused too.</p>

<p class = "style1"><strong> Attendance and Participation: </strong>
Attendance is required.
Absences will negatively impact your final grade. Exceptions will be made in accordance with <a href = "https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03"> official university policy</a>. Active participation in class will positively impact your final grade.</p>

<p class="style1"><strong> Conduct in class: </strong>
Arrive to class early, or at worst, on time.
This standard applies to your attendance after the ten minute break, as well as at the beginning of class.
Laptops are not  to be used in class unless I am accepting questions about Maple or WebAssign and have given explicit permission to the entire class.
Mobile devices must be silenced prior to the start of class and they must remain in your pocket or bag during lecture.</p>

<p class="style1"><strong> Written homework: </strong>
  I will occasionally assign written homework.
  These assignments will be easy, and their purpose is to provide an opportunity for you to gain some basic familiarity with the techniques and definitions we cover in class.
  Each assignment will receive a grade of zero or one.
  <strong>Late homeworks will not be accepted and no extensions will be granted.</strong>
  Written homework will be worth 5% of your final grade.</p>

<p class="style1"><strong> WebAssign: </strong>
All students must register online with WebAssign and pay the appropriate fees. Login to WebAssign <a href = "https://www.webassign.net/ncsu/login.html">here</a>. Due dates can be found on the WebAssign page. Do not procrastinate; start these early. <strong>Late submissions will not be accepted and no extensions will be given.</strong>
WebAssign assignments will be worth 10% of your final grade.</p>

<p class="style1"><strong> Maple: </strong>
There are eight scheduled Maple assignments distributed throughout the semester.
Due dates can be found on the course schedule.
As with the WebAssign assignments, you should avoid procrastinating on these.<strong> Late submissions will not be accepted and no extensions will be granted.</strong>
Maple assignments will be wort 10% of your final grade.
All information related to Maple can be found <a href = "http://www.math.ncsu.edu/calculus"> here</a>.</p>


<p class="style1"><strong> Tests and Final Exam: </strong>There will be four in-class tests throughout the semester. See the course schedule for dates. If you must miss a test for a reason that would grant you an excused absence according to <a href = "https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">official university policy</a>, then you will be allowed to make up that test on reading day, April 26, at 8:30 AM. If you miss a test for any other reason, then you will receive a zero. The final exam will count as 25% of your final grade. Each in-class test will count as 12.5% of your final grade.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Final Numerical Grade:</strong> Your final numerical grade will be calculated as indicated in the table below:</p>
