<p class="style1"><strong>Math 242 --  Calculus III -- Section 1</strong></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Spring 2017, &nbsp;MTWThF 8:30 -- 9:20 AM, PS 210</strong></p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Instructor:</strong> <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dibernst/">Daniel Irving Bernstein</a>, office: 4123 SAS Hall, email: <a href="mailto:dibernst@ncsu.edu">dibernst@ncsu.edu</a>.
</p>
<p class="style1">
<strong>Instructor Office Hours: </strong>Monday and Thursday 2:00 - 3:00 PM, or by appointment</p>

<p class="style1"><strong>Teaching Assistant: </strong>Helen Cleaves, Office 108 Language and Computer Labs (Laundry), email: <a href="mailto:hlcleave@ncsu.edu">hlcleave@ncsu.edu</a></p>
<p class="style1">
<strong>Teaching Assistant Office Hours:</strong> Monday 9:30  - 10:30 AM, Tuesday 2:00 - 3:00 PM, or by appointment</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Text:</strong> Franke, Griggs, and Norris, <em>Calculus III for Engineers and Scientists</em>, available with WebAssign.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Blue Books:</strong> All students must submit five small blue books and one large blue book, with absolutely nothing written on or in them, by<strong> Thursday, February 2</strong>. Please attach a sticky note with your name and give them to the instructor or the teaching assistant. Failure to do so will result in you being unable to take the first exam and thus receiving a zero.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Calculator:</strong> You will need a graphing calculator that can perform symbolic differentiation and integration in multiple variables. The TI-89 and TI-Nspire are both good choices. Other calculators may also be appropriate, but you should check with the instructor before purchasing. The use of handheld computing devices that can access the internet (e.g. cell phones) will not be allowed on tests.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Math 241 or equivalent.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Course Description: </strong> In Calculus I and II, you learned  about differentiation and integration of real-valued functions of a single variable - that is, functions with one input and one output. Here in Calculus III, we will generalize these ideas to functions with multiple inputs and/or outputs. More specifically, we will cover basic euclidean geometry in three dimensions, geometry of curves in three dimensions, limits, derivatives, and integrals of real-valued functions of multiple variables, line and surface integrals, and some vector calculus.
<p class="style1"><strong>Extra Help: </strong>The instructor and teaching assistant are free to meet with you  during their schedule office hours. All-day drop-in tutoring is available at the <a href="https://www.math.ncsu.edu/mmc/">Mathematics Multimedia Center</a> in SAS 2103-2105.
<p class="style1"><strong>Schedule: </strong> Is available <a href="schedule.html"> here</a>. 

<p class = "style1"><strong> Attendance: </strong>
Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class in accordance with university policy.</p>

<p class="style1"><strong> Conduct in class: </strong>
Arrive to class early, or at worst, on time.
Mobile devices must be silenced prior to the start of class and they must remain in your pocket or bag during lecture.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong> WebAssign: </strong>
  All students must register online with WebAssign and pay the appropriate fees. Login to WebAssign <a href = "https://www.webassign.net/ncsu/login.html">here</a>. Due dates can be found on the WebAssign page after they are assigned.  There will usually be  a few WebAssigns due each Sunday at 5:00 PM. <strong>Late submissions will not be accepted and no extensions will be given.</strong>
WebAssign assignments will be worth 12.5% of your final grade.</p>

<p class="style1"><strong> Maple: </strong>
There are eight scheduled Maple assignments distributed throughout the semester.
Due dates can be found on the course schedule.
As with the WebAssign assignments, you should avoid procrastinating on these.<strong> Late submissions will not be accepted and no extensions will be granted.</strong>
Maple assignments will be worth 12.5% of your final grade.
All information related to Maple can be found <a href = "http://www.math.ncsu.edu/calculus"> here</a>.</p>


<p class="style1"><strong> Tests and Final Exam: </strong>There will be four in-class tests throughout the semester. See the course schedule for dates. If you must miss a test for a reason that would grant you an excused absence according to <a href = "https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">official university policy</a>, then your final exam grade will count for that test <strong>if you provide appropriate documentation</strong>. If you miss a test for any other reason, or if you do not provide sufficient documentation, then you will receive a zero. The final exam will count as 25% of your final grade. Each in-class test will count as 12.5% of your final grade.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Final Numerical Grade:</strong> Your final numerical grade will be calculated as indicated in the table below:</p>
<table width="189" border="1">
